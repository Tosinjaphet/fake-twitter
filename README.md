## Teacher usage

First clone this repository to your laptop. You must have Node (> v4) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) installed.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/tmp && cd $_
git clone git@github.com:lewagon/fake-twitter.git
cd fake-twitter
yarn install
stt # Open this folder in Sublime Text
```

Make sure you have `./node_modules/.bin` in your `$PATH`! This way you can run this:

```bash
webpack-dev-server
```

Let's start the live-code!
